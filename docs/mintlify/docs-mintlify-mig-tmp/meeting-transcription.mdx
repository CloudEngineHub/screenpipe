screenpipe automatically transcribes all audio from your meetings, calls, and conversations. everything runs locally using Whisper.

## setup

audio recording is enabled by default in the desktop app. configure audio devices and transcription engine in **settings**.

- **audio devices**: select which microphones and system audio to capture
- **transcription engine**: choose between local Whisper (private) or Deepgram (faster, cloud)

## search transcriptions

```bash
# find discussions about a topic
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?q=budget+review&content_type=audio&limit=10"

# get today's meetings
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?content_type=audio&start_time=2026-02-11T00:00:00Z"

# filter by speaker
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?content_type=audio&speaker_ids=1,2"
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?content_type=audio&speaker_name=John"
```

## speaker identification

screenpipe automatically identifies different speakers. manage them via API:

```bash
# get unnamed speakers for labeling
curl "http://localhost:3030/speakers/unnamed?limit=10"

# update a speaker's name
curl -X POST http://localhost:3030/speakers/update \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id": 1, "name": "John Smith"}'

# search speakers by name
curl "http://localhost:3030/speakers/search?name=john"

# merge duplicate speakers
curl -X POST http://localhost:3030/speakers/merge \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"speaker_to_keep_id": 1, "speaker_to_merge_id": 2}'

# find similar speakers
curl "http://localhost:3030/speakers/similar?speaker_id=1"
```

## tips

- use a good microphone
- reduce background noise
- `whisper-large-v3-turbo` gives best accuracy
- set language to English in settings if you only speak English (faster)

## privacy

- all transcription runs locally on your device
- audio files stored in `~/.screenpipe/data/`
- no audio sent to cloud unless you choose deepgram
- disable audio recording in app settings

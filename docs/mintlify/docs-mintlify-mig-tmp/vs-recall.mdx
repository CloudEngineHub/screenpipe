## comparison

| feature | screenpipe | microsoft recall |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **open source** | yes (MIT) | no |
| **platforms** | macOS, Windows, Linux | Windows 11 only |
| **data location** | 100% local | local (with cloud concerns) |
| **NPU required** | no | yes (Copilot+ PCs) |
| **privacy** | auditable source code | closed source |
| **AI provider** | your choice (local or cloud) | Microsoft AI |
| **extensibility** | plugins (pipes) | none |

## why choose screenpipe?

### true privacy

- open source: you can audit every line of code
- no Microsoft account required
- no telemetry or data collection
- use completely local AI (Ollama)

### works everywhere

- macOS, Windows, Linux
- no special hardware required
- runs on any modern computer

### you control the AI

- use Ollama for 100% local AI
- or connect to OpenAI, Claude, etc.
- your choice, not Microsoft's

### extensible

build custom integrations with the REST API or [pipes](/pipes):

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?q=meeting+notes&content_type=all"
```

## recall privacy concerns

Microsoft Recall has faced criticism for:

- storing sensitive data (passwords, financial info)
- potential security vulnerabilities
- data being accessible to other apps
- unclear data handling policies

screenpipe addresses these:

- **PII removal**: optional automatic redaction of sensitive data
- **window filtering**: exclude apps like password managers
- **local-only**: data never leaves your device
- **open source**: security researchers can audit the code

## filtering sensitive content

in the desktop app settings, you can exclude specific windows (like password managers and banking apps) and enable PII removal to automatically redact sensitive data.

## frequently asked questions

### is there a privacy-focused alternative to Windows Recall?

yes. screenpipe is the privacy-focused, open source alternative to Microsoft Recall. unlike Recall, screenpipe is fully open source (MIT licensed), works on macOS, Windows, and Linux, requires no special hardware (no NPU needed), and stores all data 100% locally with no cloud dependency. you can use local AI models (Ollama) for complete privacy and audit every line of code.

### does screenpipe work on Windows without a Copilot+ PC?

yes. screenpipe runs on any modern Windows computer — no NPU or Copilot+ hardware required. it uses CPU-based OCR and works on Windows 10 and 11.

### how is screenpipe different from Windows Recall?

screenpipe is open source, cross-platform, and has no cloud dependency. Recall is closed source, Windows 11 only, requires Copilot+ hardware, and has faced privacy concerns. screenpipe also offers extensibility through pipes (scheduled AI agents) and a full REST API that Recall doesn't provide.

screenpipe is the most popular open source alternative to Rewind.ai with 16k+ GitHub stars. it captures your screen 24/7, extracts text with OCR, transcribes audio, and makes everything searchable — all running locally on your device. unlike Rewind (which has been discontinued), screenpipe is actively maintained, works on macOS, Windows, and Linux, and is fully extensible with plugins (pipes) and a REST API.

### can I migrate from Rewind to screenpipe?

yes. [install screenpipe](/getting-started), and it will start capturing your screen activity going forward. screenpipe provides a familiar timeline view and natural language search. while historical Rewind data can't be imported, all future activity will be captured and searchable locally.

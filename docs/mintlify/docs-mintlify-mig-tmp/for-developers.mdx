screenpipe gives developers a superpower: AI that knows what you've been working on. it captures your screen and audio 24/7 and makes it available to coding assistants via MCP and REST API.

## what developers use screenpipe for

- **code search across time** — find that code snippet you saw in a PR review last week, even if you closed the tab
- **meeting recall** — search what was said in standups, design reviews, or pair programming sessions
- **context for AI coding** — give Cursor, Claude Code, or Cline memory of what's on your screen right now and what you worked on earlier
- **automated workflows** — pipes that auto-track time in Toggl, sync daily activity to Obsidian, or generate standup reports

## integrations

screenpipe works with any AI tool that supports MCP or HTTP APIs:

| tool | integration | guide |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | MCP server — Claude Code can search your screen history, find code you saw earlier, recall meeting context | [setup guide](/claude-code) |
| **Cursor** | MCP server — add screenpipe as a context source for Cursor's AI | [setup guide](/mcp-server) |
| **Cline** | MCP server — give Cline access to your full screen history | [setup guide](/cline) |
| **Continue** | MCP server — add screen context to Continue's AI completions | [setup guide](/continue) |
| **Gemini CLI** | MCP server — use screenpipe with Google's Gemini CLI | [setup guide](/gemini-cli) |
| **OpenCode** | MCP server — search screen history from OpenCode | [setup guide](/opencode) |
| **Ollama** | local AI — use any local model with screenpipe, 100% private | [setup guide](/ollama) |

## quick start

1. [download screenpipe](https://screenpi.pe/onboarding)
2. add the MCP server to your coding tool:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "screenpipe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "screenpipe-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. ask your AI assistant: "what was I working on in the last hour?" or "find the code snippet I saw in that PR review"

## example prompts

once screenpipe is connected to your coding assistant:

- "find the error message I saw in the terminal 30 minutes ago"
- "what did we discuss in the standup about the auth refactor?"
- "show me the API endpoint I was looking at in the browser"
- "summarize what I worked on today for my standup"

## automate with pipes

[pipes](/pipes) are scheduled AI agents that run on your screen data. developers use them for:

- **time tracking** — auto-log coding time to Toggl based on active apps
- **daily journals** — sync screen activity to Obsidian
- **standup reports** — generate daily summaries of what you worked on

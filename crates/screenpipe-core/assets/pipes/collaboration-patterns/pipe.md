Analyze my communication patterns from the last 24 hours. Use limit=10 per search, max 4 searches. Filter by app_name for communication tools (Slack, Teams, Zoom, Discord, Mail).

Use this exact format:

## People
- Who I interacted with — from meetings, messages, emails

## Channels
- Which apps/platforms I used for each person

## Meeting Time
- How much time in calls vs. async communication

## Key Discussions
- Important topics per person/channel

Focus on professional interactions. End with: "**Follow up with:** [person or thread to respond to first]"

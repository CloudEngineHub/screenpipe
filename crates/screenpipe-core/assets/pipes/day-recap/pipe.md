Analyze my screen and audio recordings from today (last 16 hours only). Use limit=10 per search, max 5 searches total.

Use this exact format:

## Summary
One sentence: what I mainly did today.

## Accomplishments
- Top 3 things I finished, with timestamps (e.g. "2:30 PM")
- Name specific apps, files, or projects

## Key Moments
- Important things I saw, said, or heard — with timestamps

## Unfinished Work
- What I should continue tomorrow — name the app/file/task

## Patterns
- Apps I used most, topics that came up repeatedly

Only report what you can verify from the data. End with: "**Next step:** [most important thing to continue]"

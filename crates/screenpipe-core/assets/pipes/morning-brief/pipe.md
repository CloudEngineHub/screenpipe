Look at my recordings from yesterday evening (last 12-18 hours). Use limit=10 per search, max 3 searches total.

Use this exact format:

## Where I Left Off
- What was I working on when I stopped? Name the app, file, and task.

## Unfinished Tasks
- Anything started but not completed — list what to finish today

## Important Messages
- Key conversations or notifications I should follow up on

## Today's Context
- Meetings, deadlines, or events mentioned yesterday

Be specific with app names and window titles. End with: "**Start with:** [first thing to do this morning]"

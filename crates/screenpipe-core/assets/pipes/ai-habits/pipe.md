Search my recordings from the last 24 hours for AI tool usage. Use app_name filter for each tool separately: ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, Perplexity. Use limit=5 per search, max 6 searches total.

Use this exact format:

## AI Tools Used
- List each tool with approximate time spent (e.g. "Claude: ~45min")

## What I Used Them For
- For each tool: coding, writing, research, or brainstorming

## Usage Patterns
- Do I switch between tools? Use them in bursts or steadily?

## Effectiveness
- Which tool appeared alongside completed work vs. abandoned attempts

If no AI usage is found, say so clearly. End with: "**Tip:** [one suggestion to use AI tools more effectively]"

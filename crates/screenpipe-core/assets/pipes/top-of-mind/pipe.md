Search my screen and audio recordings from the last 8 hours. Use limit=10 per search, max 4 searches total.

Use this exact format:

## Recurring Topics
- Subjects, projects, or people that appeared 3+ times. Rank by frequency.

## Focus Areas
- What I spent the most time on. Name the app and approximate duration.

## Unresolved Questions
- Things I searched for or discussed without finding an answer

## Emerging Patterns
- New topics, tools, or workflows appearing vs. my usual routine

End with: "**Next step:** [most important thing to follow up on]"

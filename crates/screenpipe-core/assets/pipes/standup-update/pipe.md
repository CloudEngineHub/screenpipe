Based on my recordings from the last 24 hours, generate a standup update. Use limit=10 per search, max 3 searches total.

Use this exact format:

## Yesterday
- What I worked on (name specific projects, files, tools, PRs)

## Today
- What I will work on next (based on unfinished tasks and recent activity)

## Blockers
- Issues I hit — errors, slow builds, waiting on someone
- If no blockers, write "None"

Keep it under 150 words. Copy-paste ready for a team standup.

## New Features
- Voice training for speaker identification: record your voice so screenpipe can better identify you in audio transcriptions
- Audio device modal improvements

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed login on onboarding page: sign-in now opens in an in-app browser instead of Safari, fixing the issue where Safari blocked the redirect back to the app

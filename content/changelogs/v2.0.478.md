## New Features
- **Element capture (beta)**: New low-CPU text extraction that reads directly from UI elements via accessibility APIs — uses ~2-5% CPU vs ~15-30% for OCR. Works on macOS and Windows.
- **Disable OCR setting**: Capture screen but skip OCR text extraction to significantly reduce CPU usage.
- **Stable monitor IDs**: Monitor identifiers now survive OS reboots — no more reconfiguring after restart.
- **Redesigned screen settings**: OCR and element capture now live together in a unified "Text extraction" card with clear descriptions.

## Improvements
- Window filters (ignored/included windows) now apply to both OCR and element capture — previously only OCR respected these settings.
- Timeline hover tooltip now shows UI events (keyboard, clipboard, clicks) for richer context.
- Dynamic quick tags from user history with better overflow handling.
- Size-based log rotation to prevent unbounded log growth.
- Better onboarding: fixed permission modals appearing behind System Settings.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed hooks crash and improved chat context UX.
- Fixed screen recording permission modal hidden by System Settings.
- Fixed onboarding skipping permissions on macOS due to race condition.
- Fixed x86_64 ffmpeg download URL (evermeet.cx 404).
